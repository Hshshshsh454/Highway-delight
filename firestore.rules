/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for the Experience Booking Application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a user-ownership model for user profiles and bookings,
 * while allowing public read access to experiences and time slots.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /experiences/{experienceId}: Publicly readable information about experiences.
 * - /users/{userId}: Private user profiles, accessible only to the owning user.
 * - /users/{userId}/bookings/{bookingId}: Bookings made by a user, accessible only to that user.
 * - /experiences/{experienceId}/timeSlots/{timeSlotId}: Publicly readable time slots for each experience.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User profiles are strictly private; only the authenticated user can read or write their own profile.
 * - Bookings are owned by the user who created them and are stored under the user's profile.
 * - Experiences and time slots are publicly readable but writes are not authorized.
 * - Listing of users is not permitted.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * The `userId` field in the `/users/{userId}/bookings/{bookingId}` collection
 * is used for authorization.  This avoids needing to query the user document
 * to check ownership.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 * User profiles and public experience data are stored in separate collections
 * to maintain a clear separation of concerns and security postures.
